This hands-on workshop aims to equip participants with the fundamentals of reproducible research with R Markdown and related tools. This is designed for those who have no or little prior experience with R Markdown and who want to learn Quarto the next generation of R Markdown for publishing, including dynamic and static documents and multi-lingual programming language support.

The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Data Carpentry workshops. Data Carpentryâ€™s mission is to train researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.
